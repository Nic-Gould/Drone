This 2020 paper makes it sound relatively easy, as all that is required is new HAL for the new board.

However they were unable to acheive great funtionality as "t is essential to have fast, reliable and fluid communication with
critical sensors such as the AHRS. However, as we saw in sec-
tion 2.2, it is necessary to recode the communication protocols
for the ESP32 but the current version of our implementation
is not yet sufficiently optimized for the frequencies of use re-
quired by a flying drone (of the order of several hundred Hz)."
